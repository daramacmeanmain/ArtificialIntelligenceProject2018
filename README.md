# Artificial Intelligence Project 2018

This repository contains the code for my Artificial Intelligence project, which is to break a Playfair Cipher using a simulated annealing algorithm.

## Funtionality

The programme allows a user to choose between loading a decrypted text file that is stored locally, or with a URL. Once the text is loaded in, a random 25 letter key will be generated to attempt decryption. This key is displayed in the form of a 5 x 5 table, along with the result of the attempted decryption.


## Issues

* URL option is present but most of the actual functionality is not implemented.

* I was unsuccessful in implementing the simulated annealing algorithm correctly, as such the programme will only offer the first attempted result of decryption
